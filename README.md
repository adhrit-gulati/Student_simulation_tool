# Student_simulation_tool
This is a simulation tool i am designing for educational purposes. It will contain all manner of rigidbody, electric field, current simulations to illustrate various physics concepts. Built using python and arcade module

# features to add (in order of priority)
- [ ] rods, torque etc.
- [x] trails for moving objects
- [ ] Current/electricity submodule (simple DC circuits)
- [ ] Springs, hooke's law, immovable blocks
- [ ] add main interface
- [ ] optics, light reflection and refraction, lenses
- [ ] 3D capability
- [ ] magnetic field, magnetism, lorentz force
